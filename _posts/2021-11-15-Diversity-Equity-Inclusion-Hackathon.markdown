I floated the idea of a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Hackathon recently. I thought I would create this page to be more open and transparent.

The idea would be to make it collaborative, not competitive. I am also thinking of breaking the problem owner / problem solver paradigm.

There was another [DEI hackathon from GoCo](https://www.goco.io/blog/diversity-equity-inclusion-hackathon/) that looked interesting, but I didn't see any followups (it was supposed to have been organised in May 2021).

Any suggestions? Why not drop them in the [issues area](https://github.com/Practical-DEI/collaborate/issues) or you could [contact me via LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/rowlandm-gaicd)
